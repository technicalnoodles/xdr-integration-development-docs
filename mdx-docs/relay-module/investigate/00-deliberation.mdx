# Deliberation Development

To make a Deliberation integration, you can either continue to use the **Generic Serverless Relay** or update your Module Type to support the Deliberate endpoint.

## Update Module Type JSON

Go to the Module Maker and click on the **Open JSON from File** option on the top left of the page. Select the JSON file for the Wazuh module and open it.

Once it is opened, it should look similar to the below:
![json](./img/default-json.png)

Check the three tiles options so we make sure those stay there from the previous section and give them a description.

Now check the _deliberate/observables_ option and give it a description.
![updated json](./img/updated-json.png)

Now save the JSON and patch our module using the IROH Swagger docs.

You should get a response with the updated API endpoints and Deliberate should be listed in it.

## Create Deliberate API Endpoint

In your IDE, create a new folder in the **routes** folder called **deliberate**. Then create a new file called **deliberateRoute.js**
